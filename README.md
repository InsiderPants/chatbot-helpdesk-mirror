# Chatbot-Helpdesk

<h4>Introduction</h4>

In order to improve customer service experience, we designed a chatbot which can interpret the customer queries, search the database for a resolution and if exists, show that to the customer. If the resolution doesnâ€™t exist or customer is not satisfied with the resolution provided
by the chatbot, hand it over to support staff. The chatbot learns over time as executive can "teach" the chatbot to respond to new queries. The system also provides analytics of how the chatbot performs.
